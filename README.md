## Features

- **Dynamic Layout**: Automatically adjusts the number of items per row based on the container's width.
- **Alternating Rows**: Even and odd rows are aligned differently (left-to-right and right-to-left) for a visually appealing zigzag effect.
- **Custom Icons**: Each document status is represented by a unique icon from the `lucide-react` library.
- **Detailed Information**: Displays the status name, date, and the user/system that registered the status.
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on different screen sizes.

# Usability Tips

## 1. Responsive Design:

Ensure the parent container of the HorizontalTimeline component has a defined width. This allows the component to calculate the number of items per row dynamically.

Test the component on different screen sizes to ensure it looks good on both desktop and mobile devices.

## 2. Customization:

You can customize the icons and text for each status by modifying the iconMapping and statusTextMapping objects in the mappings.tsx file.

To change the vertical size, override the CSS classes used in the component.

## 3. Accessibility:

Add aria-label or aria-describedby attributes to improve accessibility for screen readers.

Ensure the color contrast between the icons and the background meets accessibility standards.
